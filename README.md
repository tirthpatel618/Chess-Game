# Chess-Game
Welcome to the game!
The game is fairly straightforward, and by simply following the prompts, you will be able to play without any errors. 
Try to input only correct piece names, and valid moves
The game follows touch rules, which means once you input a piece, you must move it, but if it was done by accident, simply enter a move that is not valid, and you will able to move a different piece
When castling, please do it through the king, (input the king as the piece you are moving)
After promoting, the display will show Queen, but you will still have to input the original piece name (eg. Wpawn3 instead of Wqueen)
Make sure that once a piece is captured, do not input that piece, and If you do, enter an unvalid move.
